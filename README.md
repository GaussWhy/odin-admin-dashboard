# odin-admin-dashboard

In this project, I attempted to create a Sample Admin Dashboard webpage based off of this link: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/43cc6ab69fdfbef40d431a65677d2144668930ac/intermediate_html_css/grid/project_admin_dashboard/imgs/dashboard-project.png

This project utilized HTML and CSS.  This webpage is not fully responsive, but does have responsive parts.  CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox were used to layout the items on the webpage.  The hardest part of the webpage was laying out the "Your Projects" section properly.  After much trial and error, I found success in using grid-template-areas.  A future learning goal would be to make the entire webpage responsive.
